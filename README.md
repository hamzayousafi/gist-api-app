# gist-api-app
This is a web application written in Django Framework. It allows a user to search for publically available gists of a particular github user. It displays all the files that the gist have and you can also view the file content by just clicking on it. Additionally, it also show the most recent users who have forked that gist.

The frontend of the app seems very minimal. I have created a SOFT UI with pure css using neumorphism techniques. Feel free to use and update. Your feedback is highly appreciated.
